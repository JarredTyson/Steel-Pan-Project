## Testing
|Performance | Accessibility | Best Practises | SEO | Overall |
|------------|---------------|----------------|-----|---------|
|70 |85 |87 | 83 | 70 |

Ran the CSS file through W3C CSS Validation Service. It came back with 6 errors that have now been edited and then put back through to receive W3C CSS Validator results for TextArea (CSS level 3 + SVG)
Ran the index.html file through W3C HTML Validation service to make amends to any errors and changed the necessary code to suit a better structure. The Nu HTML checker ensured the ‘Document checking completed. No errors or warning to show’. 

## Further Testing 
I ran the site continuously on Google Chrome on a large screen and the site generally ran how I imagined it to look.
I also tested the site on Sarafi, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. 
The website was reviewed on a number of devices such as Ipad air, iphone, 15inch laptop and 13 inch laptop and wide 24inch desktop screen.
Testing was done to ensure links did not break.  

### Known Bugs
* Buttons on Google maps change due to styling errors. 
* One bug is when using the google maps the whole page shift to display class contents.
* Many of the items you click on the page refresh the page and bring you back.
* Ideally the contacts page should not move when you close sidebar. 
### Resolved Bugs 
* Google maps api was not working but eventually managed to integrate both the marker and 
* Mail api was not working despite many attempts and ending up using example code on the website.
* The sidebar was not moving the contents as intended and had to remove layers/containers or select correct containers to move.
