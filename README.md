## Testing
|Performance | Accessibility | Best Practises | SEO | Overall |
|------------|---------------|----------------|-----|---------|
|70 |85 |87 | 83 | 70 |

Ran the CSS file through W3C CSS Validation Service. It came back with 6 errors that have now been edited and then put back through to receive W3C CSS Validator results for TextArea (CSS level 3 + SVG)
Ran the index.html file through W3C HTML Validation service to make amends to any errors and changed the necessary code to suit a better structure. The Nu HTML checker ensured the ‘Document checking completed. No errors or warning to show’. 


1.	As a new visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate the site, do that I can find what I need efficiently.
i.	No matter what page the new visitor lands on, they can easily find and use the navigation bar.
ii.	The logo image always leads back to the home page ( the starting place for most client stories).
iii.	The Get Quote located on the middle of the page is clear and centrally located with clear indication and a good description on the functionality. 

2.	As a returning customer I want to get an update on the band progress and relearn/familiarise myself of the band performance. 
i.	I can look into the gallery page to see some of the previous events they’ve played for. 
ii.	I have a link to their social media links that can give details into their recent experiences in events. 

## Further Testing 
I ran the site continuously on Google Chrome on a large screen and the site generally ran how I imagined it to look.
I also tested the site on Sarafi, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. 
The website was reviews on a number of devices such as Ipad air, iphone, 15inch laptop and 13 inch laptop and wide 24inch desktop screen.
Testing was done to ensure links did not break.  

### Known Bugs

* One problem that occurs is the book online section where the header lines are not centred.
The gallery page when tested on my Iphone 8 was quite short and doesn’t have the feature of being able to click into the picture to get a larger view.
* Many of the items you click on the page refresh the page and bring you back to the top which is a slight inconvenience as links will be added in the future.
* The carousel item moves the entire page when it goes onto a different picture. 
### Resolved Bugs 
* The photos in the carousel were squashed and to resolve I used the “object-fit: cover;” function so the images don’t look squashed and fill the entire space.
* I found that none of the styling elements were working despite many trials to eventually find that the style-sheet was not correctly added in the header.
* In the header I noticed that the carousel was not working. After close inspection I found that “carousel-Inidicators” was spelt wrong. This was not enabling the carousel to move. Re-spelt the word ‘Indicators’ and the slider began to work.
